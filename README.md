To run this script, simply open it in Rstudio and Source it.  You can use the hotkey Ctrl+Shift+S if your mouse is malfuncitoning.

The goal of this script is to take data from the following source and make it tidy for subsequent analysis.

See the following link for more information about the original datasource:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data ingested by run_analysis.R is here:

If this script functions correctly, it will write out a file combinedTidyAverage.txt to the same directory as this README file.  This file will have all of the properties that are described in the CODEBOOK document, and you will award me full credit for my hard work and dedication to the art of data science.

Cheers!
